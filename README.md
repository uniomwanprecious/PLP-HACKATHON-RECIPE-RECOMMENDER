Recipe Recommender App
This is a full-stack Python application that recommends recipes based on ingredients you have at home. It is designed for students on a budget who want to eat healthy, home-cooked meals without food waste.

Features
AI-Powered Recipe Generation: The application uses the OpenAI API to generate recipe suggestions based on ingredients provided by the user.

Database Integration: Recipes generated by the AI are saved to a MySQL database for easy retrieval and future use.

Secure Payment Integration: A checkout endpoint with Paystack API integration demonstrates how to handle secure online payments for potential premium features.

Frontend-Backend Communication: Built with the Flask framework to create robust API endpoints.

Secure API Key Management: Environment variables are used to securely manage API keys and other sensitive credentials, ensuring they are not exposed in the codebase.

Database Setup:
Create a recipes table in your MySQL database to store the recommended recipes.

SQL

CREATE DATABASE recipe_recommender;

USE recipe_recommender;

CREATE TABLE recipes (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    ingredients TEXT NOT NULL,
    instructions TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
